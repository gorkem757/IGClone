# IGClone
Instagram Clone App
To visualize this project. In console execute -> expo start -c.
!! Make sure to run npm install first.
This is going to open the metro bundler in web. From there If you have a simulator running. Choose the option Run in iOS / Run in Android simulator 
depending on the simulators OS. 

The reason that I used expo is that I had a problem with the Android Studio's simulators that I could not get to make them work.
The only help that expo package provides is about monitoring the application other than that that package did not granted anything. 

Feedbacks are appreciated.
Thanks in advance...
