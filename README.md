-> npm start -c.

This is going to open the metro bundler in web. 
From there If you have a simulator running. 
Choose the option Run in iOS / Run in Android simulator depending on the simulator's OS. 

The reason that I used expo is that I had a problem with the Android Studio's simulators that I could not get to make them work.
The only help that expo package provides is about monitoring the application, and displaying videos which I have not figured

Feedbacks are appreciated.
Thanks in advance...
